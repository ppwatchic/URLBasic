##What is URL

1. Most URLs refer to a file on some machine on the network  
:smirk: However, remember that URLs also can point to other resources on the network, such as database queries and command output.

 | :------------- |
 | URL is an acronym for **Uniform Resource Locator** and is a reference (an address) to a resource on the Internet. |

2. A URL has two main components

  * Protocol identifier: For the URL http://example.com, the protocol identifier is http.

  * Resource name: For the URL http://example.com, the resource name is example.com.
 
3. The resource name is the complete address to the resource. The format of the resource name depends entirely on the protocol used, but for many protocols, including HTTP, the resource name contains one or more of the following components:

  **Host Name**  
  The name of the machine on which the resource lives.

  **Filename**  
  The pathname to the file on the machine.

  **Port Number**  
  The port number to which to connect (typically optional).

  **Reference**  
  A reference to a named anchor within a resource that usually identifies a specific location within a file (typically optional).
